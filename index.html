            <p>Hi, I'm Mrs. Comfort,  a 45 year old mother of two  blessed with a thriving restaurant  business.
            </p> 
            <p>
              As a businesswoman, I normally wake up before 6 a.m. to avoid traffic and arrive at my shop on time.
              </P>
            <p>Everything was well with me until I began to notice pains in my joints, which I ignored and continued to manage since. I assumed my body was simply reacting to the stress associated with my kind of business.
            </p>
            <p>I will have to wake up very early, struggle to get a boss in the morning as a result of Lagos rush hour. Since my shop is in the Island while I live In the mainland</p>
            </p>

            <p>
             My belief was that it would go away with time. 
            </p>
            <p>
            However, it began to worsen with time. I wasn't seeing  any changes, so I believed the solution was pain relievers. I bought a lot of them but it was ineffective. 
            </p>
            
            <p>At a point in time I thought it was a spiritual attack, that my enemies are trying to kill me the way they killed my husband untimely.</p>
            <p>My pastor prayed for me.</p>
            <p>And also advised me to come to Lagos University Teaching Hospital(LUTH) to have some checkups as he work there as a specialist doctor</p>
            
            <p>
            After several tests and examination, I was told I'm  suffering from Arthritis and I've been given several medications, but they only work for a short time. 
            </p>
            <p>The medication I was given would only work for a few weeks before the pain would come back and torture me deep inside my bones.
            </p>
            <p>
            That nearly paralyzed me. Before you know it I'm back to square on. I was advised that the only way out was to get surgery.

            </p>
            <p>
           Instead of having surgery, I choose to leave this world. I had given up on EVERYTHING since I've tried different medication

            </p>

            <p>
            Call it destiny, good fortune, or a sign from above I bumped into an old business partner on a faithful day and talked about everything that was going on with me, I also didn't fail to mention the constant pains I have been dealing with.            </p>
            <p>
            She said my story was relatable because her husband faced almost the same thing and she was the one taking care of him all that while, she mentioned a particular video her husband came across on facebook.

            </p>
            <p>
          The video talked about a Nigerian doctor who resides in India that discovered a secret india herbal solution for Arthritis 
            </p>
            <p>
            After a few days, she sent me a link to the said video which explained in details  all  the Indian herb was about. The special advantage was that payment could be made upon delivery, which made me pleased. I placed an order right away, and it was delivered within 48 hours.            </p>
            <p>
            I used it the first week, then the second. The outcome was MAGICAL, and I began to feel better and better. 
            </p>
            <p>
               I was shocked at how easily I could get out of bed, into and out of the car, and move around in general. My joints, particularly my knees and fists, have miraculously regained mobility.

            </p>
            <p>
                Back pain has gone. I now sleep better and wake up more energized. My knees are feeling better again. All of the aches and pains I used to have are now a thing of the past. 
            </p>
            <p>
           Even my doctor, who was concerned about my condition, was surprised by the result.
 
            </p>
            <p>
            I was overjoyed because I can now move freely without pain.
